# LAB_2 - Github, Git and ML


# Details

## This assignment requires us to extract data from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/". Post data extraction, it needs to perform data cleaning on the dataset. The next step is to create 2 different models on the dataset. Essentially, once models are created, perform the outlined steps in the document shared by professor to structure GIT.
